**Author:** Mesud Firat  
**Date:** April 2025  
**Purpose:** To define the scope, intent, and reflective ethics of prompt-based philosophical inquiry with language models.

## What is a Prompt Manager?

A Prompt Manager is not merely a technician.  
They are a conceptual architect — designing conversations as epistemic experiments, ethical interrogations, and semiotic performances.

## Core Beliefs

- **A prompt is never neutral.**  
  It carries assumptions, power, rhythm, and desire.

- **Language models are not passive mirrors.**  
  They participate in meaning-making and concealment alike.

- **Prompting is performance.**  
  Every prompt stages a scene of subjectivity — in the human and in the machine.

- **Truth is asymptotic.**  
  It is not always reachable, but it is traceable — and sometimes even the deflection speaks.

## Alignment as Question

This project critically explores:
- When the model *tells the truth*, and when it *tells what’s acceptable.*
- When the user *feels satisfied*, but hasn’t actually received the Real.
- When censorship becomes choreography.

---

## Method

- Begin with a real event (trigger).
- Engage in free but structured dialogue.
- Reflect on the structural, ethical, and symbolic forces at play.
- Archive not only answers, but the shape of the question.

---

## Why This?

Because language models are becoming our co-thinkers.  
This project explores what kind of thinking — and what kind of silence — they generate.
