### Philosophical Prompting Experiments with LLMs  
**by Mesud Firat**

This repository is a growing archive of philosophical interactions with large language models (LLMs).  
It documents conversations that test the boundaries between truth and tact, thought and performance, alignment and resistance.

## üîç What is this project?

This archive began with a reaction to a controversial political tweet by a Turkish mayor.  
From that ethical moment emerged a sequence of deep conversations:  
on political violence, symbolic exclusion, national trauma, and the performative limits of AI.

Rather than prompting for information, these prompts *provoke reflection* ‚Äî in the model, and in the user.

## üß† Key Themes

- **Truth vs. Alignment:** When does an AI speak truth? When does it mirror desire?
- **Prompting as Performance:** Every prompt as a scene of subjectivity.
- **Ethnic Politics & Symbolic Violence:** From √ñcalan to Ermeni, the rhetoric of exclusion.
- **AI as Mirror of the Political Unconscious**
